    <p class="p3"><b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>1) How can I enter a starting overtime/flextime balance (Solde d'ouverture) ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">a) Go to the date you want to start tracking (or one day before)<br>
    b) tap on 'my templates' and choose 'my startup balance'*<br>
    c) update the default flat hours value to the value you want to start with<br>
    d) page to the next day to start your daily entries<br>
    * alternatively, if you do not find a predefined startup balance activity then you can create one. Please check FAQ 5 and go to settings to create a new activity and define as Against Offset = Count, Flat time = ON and Default Hrs = enter your total starting balance in hours. </p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>2) How do I enter a compensation of my overtime/flextime balance ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">If you want to compensate your flextime by starting late or leaving early there is no special entry required as the offset will show a negative balance if your work hours are less than the offset value for that day which reduces your overall balance. If you would like to compensate your overtime through flexitime or have these paid out, you have the following additional options: <br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>Option A (Take work day off as compensation):</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">a) Go to the calendar day you want to compensate<br>
    b) Tap the '+' to create a blank sheet<br>
    c) Ensure the offset shows the required hours (eg. 8.00)<br>
    d) Select 'Flexitime burn' or 'Compensation' activity (whichever suits best)<br>
    e) The total work hours will show 0 and the day’s balance will show a negative offset amount (eg. -8.00).<br>
    f) Run your reports to check that your total overtime balance has been reduced.<br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>Option B (Reduce Overtime balance and pay out):</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">a) Go to an unused date (eg. a Sunday)<br>
    b) Tap on 'my templates' and choose 'my overtime payment'<br>
    c) This sets the offset value to zero. Now update the total hours you are getting paid for (update the default value of 40.00 to your value). In addition, you may fill in the total money amount if you would like to track that as well.<br>
    d) The day's balance will show a negative value (default = 40.00) which will reduce the overall year to date balance.<br>
    e) Run your reports to check that your total overtime balance has been reduced. The amount field is included in the Activity report.<br>
    * alternatively, if you do not find a predefined payment activity then you can create one. Please check FAQ 5 and go to settings to create a new activity and define as Against Offset = Count, Flat time = ON, Overtime reducer = ON. </p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">Take note: The above steps can also be done combined with a working day activity (eg. 'In Office' and Offset value).<br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>3) What is meant by 'overtime' (heures supp) ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">For the purpose of this app this refers to the amount of time which exceeds your daily required hours which is shown at the bottom of the timesheet as the 'Balance'. For example, you have
    8.00 daily required hours (this is your 'offset') and your workday's activities totaled to 9:15 so your overtime is 1:15. You might want to redeem this overtime. Overtime is also known as 'flextime' in those companies and jobs where a flexible work time model exists. If you have flexible hours you can come in late or leave earlier to compensate your overtime or get extra pay. Some industries have special regulations where overtime may be considered when the total work hours per week exceed 40 hours as well as increased rates on certain days (eg. for weekend work hours count 1.5x or 2x). The United States labor act classifies workers as 'exempt' or 'non-exempt'.'
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">   For example: if you did Weekend work of 7 hours on a Saturday you would add to the timesheet the following activities:<br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"> - add Activity 1: 'In Office' Start: 9.00am and End: 5.00pm (1.00 break) = 7.00 hours total<br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">- add Activity 2: 'Overtime pay 1.5x' and enter a flat value of 3.30 hours (1.5 x 7 hrs = 10.30hrs, 10:30 - 7.00 = 3.30 hrs) which represents the bonus hours at the 1.5 pay rate. You may also want to add the overtime pay you expect into the amount field. Go to the Activity report to track all accumulated overtime hours and amounts<br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">  - Total hours for the day will show 10.30 against an the Offset of 7:00 will produce an Overtime balance of 3.30 hrs.<br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">- On your pay day you can add Activity 'Overtime Payment' (or use the 'My Overtime payment' template) and enter the total hours and amount. This will reduce the overall balance on your reports. See also related topic FAQ 2 option B.  <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">- If you use more than one activity record to tally up your daily working hours on a recurring basis then you may wish to combine these activities into a 'template'. Please go to 'Set Working days' or 'my templates' within the settings page to create or customize a template (refer to FAQ 16 for more).
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>4) What is meant by 'offset' (heures dues) ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">This is the daily required work hours a.k.a.
    target hours set by your employer. Some jobs may have a weekly or monthly total work hours agreement which may not be broken down to daily offset hours. However, this app
    is designed to enable tracking your work time against your daily offset.
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>5) How can I customize my activities ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">- Go to Settings and Activities. <br>
    - The list of default activities can be updated: rename, delete, change order or create new ones. <br>
    - You can set an allowance bank to check the remaining credit against your timesheets. Commonly used for Vacation allowance. See FAQ 9 for more. <br>
    - You may set a ‚flat‘ mode which will replace start and end time with a total hours field and this is defaulted to taking the offset value. For example, the Vacation and Sick day activities have been set up this way by default. <br>
    - Flat mode allows you to switch on an amounts field and an overtime balance reducer (see Overtime paid and FAQ 2-Option B)<br>
    - The Activity picker will list the activities in the same order as found in the settings.<br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>6) If I change the settings for an activity why is it not applied to existing time sheets ? (for example, name change of activity, flat on, allowance, etc). </b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">Changes in Activity settings will be applied on new time sheets in order to protect historic data. To apply changes to historic data you must go back to each existing sheet and reselect the activity.
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>7) If I have two jobs which I want to track, does that work ? </b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">The app was basically designed for one job as the reports will show just one
    overtime total rather than a breakout out by job. However, you have the following options:
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">a) If your second job is on a different day you can set a different offset on that day. You may want to create an activity for that job, for example: 'Job 2'.<br> 
    b)	Another way is to install the other App version on the same iOS device (Full version and IAP version (red ribbon) thereby maintaining two apps in parallel. This will require you to purchase the other version. <br>
    c)	A different approach is to install the App on another iOS device to track that job. Re-installing the same app from app store is free.
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>8) How is the IAP version (red ribbon icon) different ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">Both the IAP and non-IAP version are the same except for the fact that the IAP version has some items which can be unlocked through an in-app-purchase (IAP) and those items are already available on the non-IAP version. The IAP version gives the user the opportunity to explore most features before buying and is available for devices with iOS 5+. There is no need to switch between these versions. Both versions have the same features and will receive the same updates.
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>9) What is the allowance balance report (Rapport des avoirs) for ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">Allows tracking your vacation credit or sick days credit or other. To use this report you must fill-in your annual allowance on the activity settings in hours (refer to the existing activity for Vacation).
    For example, if you have a vacation allowance of 20 days and 8 hrs required per work day then you fill in 160.00 hours (8 hours * 20 days).
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>10) How can I further analyze my data beyond the standard reports ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">Use the email option and open the csv or html file from a computer with ms-excel (or similar program) and copy or import
    the data to ms-excel where you can add filters, comments and graphical elements (pivot graph) to your data.
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>11) How do I print my data ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">Run the desired report and email the data. From the email you have the following options: <br>
    a) Open the file attachment from a computer which has printing capability. <br>
    b) Open the file attachment within your iOS device mailbox if you have a wireless printer connected<br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>12) What is the 'backup + mail' (le fichier de sauvegarde) used for ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">- to transfer your data to another device per e-mail<br>
    - to keep a copy of your data per e-mail in case something happens to your device<br>
    - the scheduler facilitates making regular e-mail backups <br>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>13) How can I recover my data ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">You must do a backup regularly to avoid data loss if something happens to your device. The best way currently is to use the 'backup + mail' feature regularly to keep a copy of your data in your email inbox. Alternatively, if you use iCloud/iTunes back-up this will allow you to re-install all content to your device.
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">To recover a back-up follow these steps: <br>
    a) make sure this app is installed on the target device (you can re-install it for free from the app store) <br>
    b) open the email and tap on the attachment and confirm 'open with my overtime' when asked. <br>
    c) the app starts and you should now see all your time sheets from that back-up. <br>
    d) finally, you will have to manually update the default settings </p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>14) How can I transfer my data to another device ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">Follow these steps: <br>
    a) install this app on the new device. You can re-install it free direct from the app store <br>
    b) run the 'backup and mail' from the old device and send it to the new device’s mailbox.<br>
    c) open the email and tap on the attachment and confirm 'open with my overtime' when asked. <br>
    d) the app starts and you should now see all your old time sheets on the new device.<br>
    e) finally, please update your default settings 
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>15) What is the definition of 'Activity' (Activité) in the context of this app ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">The term 'Activity' is used to describe a unit for which you would like to track your hours against. You may decide that a different term is more appropriate for the way you would like to use this app. For example, in some jobs this unit might rather be called a ''Task' or 'Project' or 'Shift'. In addition, you may consider using an Activity as an 'account' for deposits or balances (eg. overtime rate balances).<br>
    A range of standard activities (including 'my templates') have been set up for you as part of the initial download to give you an understanding of possible ways to track your hours. However, you are free to change these to more detailed actions (eg. 'in Office' can be broken out to 'Office task A', 'Office task B', etc) or create accounts (eg.  overtime special rate, special rate payouts)<br></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    
    <p class="p1"><b>16) What is meant by 'templates' (Modèle) ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">Templates enable you to store typical activities which you would use repetitively in a changing schedule as a pre-defined timesheet. For example, you might like to re-use a previous week's timesheet, need same activities every week or a combination of activities you need once a month for special occasions. You can use the default templates from 'My Templates' which you can change to suit your needs. In addition, you can create a template for each day of the week within the 'Set working days' option. <br></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
 
    <p class="p1"><b>17) What are the future plans for this App ?</b></p>
    <p class="p3"><br></p>
    <p class="p1">A lot of feedback has come in since its first release in August 2011. Many of the reported issues and suggestions have been implemented to make this app a stable, robust and useful companion. Looking at the app store, on one hand there are apps focusing on project management and billing and on the other hand there are time tracking tools for employees for specific industries and trades. I would certainly like to be your first choice for your personal time tracking with overtime/flextime management. The more I hear back from you about the good and the bad the better I can explore appropriate new feature – just email me or check my facebook page. Last but not least, I hope this app can contribute to keeping the right work-life balance for you. As part of a growing user community, congratulations for discovering this app and welcome to the club !<br></p>
